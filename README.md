# Network-Design-Configuration-and-Emerging-Issues-and-Technology-in-Cloud-Security-Portfolio
A 3-part portfolio demonstrating network-security skills: subnet/VLAN config, secure remote access, email/FTP/Telnet/SSH setup, and a literature review on emerging network/cloud security issues and their impact on modern cloud-risk assessment practices.
This portfolio is a three-part demonstration of proficiency across the full network-security lifecycle: Task 1 challenges to plan, address, configure and verify a multi-subnet “My School Network,” evidencing practical skills in device setup, VLANs, routing, wireless and secure remote management; Task 2 extends the hands-on focus by requiring to build and secure inter-site communications in the “Communicating in a Cyber World” scenario sending email, transferring files,and administering routers via Telnet and SSH, while analysing the security implications of each service; finally,Task 3 shifts to critical scholarship,asking to produce a literature-based review of emerging issues and technologies in network and cloud security, evaluating how these developments reshape contemporary cloud-risk assessment practices. Together, the three tasks integrate design, configuration, troubleshooting, secure operations and reflective research.
